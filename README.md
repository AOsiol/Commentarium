# Commentarium

With this app, the user is able to keep track of information in an interface similar to a notebook or planner. The entries have a header and body. They are then logged in the server where they can be retrieved to view or delete.

## Getting Started

The appilcation is run off of a server. The user will have to interact with the app on the webpage itself.
